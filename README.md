# rust-by-example

My version of a working diary of learning with the [rust-by-example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) and the google's [Comprehensive rust tutorial](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust)

This log will help me focus on learning by doing and evolve this project with more features like, actively running CI, deployment and observability with rust.

The idea would be to build smaller programs of Rust, deploy them to containers, run the programs using GH Actions CI and Observe the SLO of the programs using a Rust monitoring stack.

Also would like to focus writing good documentation for this programming learning journey using ASCII docs.

Good Luck to me, I guess !
